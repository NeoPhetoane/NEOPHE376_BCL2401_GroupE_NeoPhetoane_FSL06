**Overview**
This project is a site that allows a customer to add food to their order and it automatically calculates the total price. It consists of arrays to specify the food, a function to display the menu items and another function to add the orders to a list and calculate its total value.

**Reflections**

**Areas of Mastery**

Arrays: I am able to effectively write out arrays and then reference them in functions.

Functions: There are two functions, one that displays the menu items and another that adds the items and then calculates them. They were very elaborate and I was able to make them function.

Using event-listeners: This is what allows the menu item to be added to the order list when the user clicks on it.

Fetching and creating elements: I was able to efficiently know when to create elements and when to fetch them for use inside the functions.

**Challenges Faced**
Prices: I struggled a little regarding the prices. Whether to nest them within the array or to create their own variable. Their own variable proved easier to use.

Calculation: Making the calculator function work, using the parsFloat element to ensure accurate calculations.

**Areas for Improvement**
Removing Items: I noticed that once the user clicked the item, they could not remove it. This makes the user experience unpleasant as there is no room for mistakes and correcting them.

Displaying the prices: Another non user friendly property of the site as it is, is that one is unable to see the prices until they click on it and when they click another one, it adds it to the previous one. This creates a nightmare for users being able to estimate how much they are willing to spend.

**Overall Learning Experience**

This project was an effective function and array practice while including referencing HTML. It required careful following of what one was doing inorder to complete the complicated and long functions while referencing them properly.
